collection = {1, 2, 3, 4, "hello"}

print(collection)
print(type(collection))
print(len(collection)) # Total number of items.

#TODO: Even if we made duplicate items, but set ignore them during print and anything else like length of string. Example bELOW :

# collection = {1, 2, 2, 2, "hello", "world", "world", "hello"}

#print(collection)
#print(type(collection))
#print(len(collection))

#TODO: For creating empty set we use below functions

# collection = {}   --> This is a Dictionary empty function.

collection = set()  # --> This is a Set empty function.
